## **Step 3:** Connection ADW ml_user

- Here we will lost the mining model that as created in the notebook

- Copy and paste the following into SQL Developer Web

```
<copy>select * from user_Mining_models;</copy>
N1_CLASS_MODEL    CLASSIFICATION    DECISION_TREE    NATIVE    05-MAR-20        0    NO    

```
## **Step 4:** Create a database link between ADW and ATP
