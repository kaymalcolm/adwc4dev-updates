# Creating the Machine Learning Model

## Introduction

In this lab, you will:

- In ADW:
  - Log into SQL Developer Web and enable user ml_user access to sqldeveloper web.
  - Grant storage priviledges to ml_user
  - Log in with ml_user and export the model to a temporary table.
- In ATP:
  - Create a database link that will be used to copy (pull) an export of the ml model from ADW to ATP.
  - Create a new ml_user and grant that user access to sqldeveloper web, and to storage.
  - Copy the model from ADW to ATP.
  - Log in with ml_user and import the ml model.
  - Create a virtual column on the table that applies the model to rows in the table.
